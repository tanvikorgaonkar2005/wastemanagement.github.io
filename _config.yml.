### Hello, I'm Tanvi Korgaonkar üëã

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## üõ† Projects
- *Project 1*:Urban waste management faces two significant issues: inefficient garbage collection and
 improper waste sorting. Fixed routes for garbage trucks often result in missed collections and wasted resources.
  On top of this, waste sorting is largely manual, which leads to errors and reduced recycling efficiency. 
  As a result, more waste ends up in landfills, causing environmental damage and increased operational costs.

Modules:
1. Waste Generation Monitoring:  
   Waste management agencies will use this module to gather real-time data on waste generation. The system will identify waste types and detect patterns in waste production.
   
2. Route Optimization:  
   Waste management agencies will also benefit from this module, which will use algorithms like Dijkstra‚Äôs to optimize the garbage trucks' routes based on traffic data and waste generation patterns, reducing operational costs and improving efficiency.

3. Waste Classification:  
   This module will be used by recycling companies to automatically classify waste as recyclable, organic, or general. 

3. Waste Valuation: 
    In this module the classifed waste will go to factory depending upon its category.
